75f,https://www.75f.io/,"75f is a provider of cloud platform along with wireless zone controllers to monitor temperature, tracking the energy requirements among others. It fixes wide temperature imbalances in a typical commercial building. Its module senses the temperature in each room and sends it wirelessly to a Central Control Unit that replaces a standard thermostat. The CCU aggregates the data and sends it to servers in the cloud to predict thermal loads across the building based on historical data and forecast weather. The optimum control strategy is then sent back to the CCU which turns on or off the HVAC equipment and instructs the room modules to modulate the dampers.
